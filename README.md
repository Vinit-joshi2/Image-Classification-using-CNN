# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with Pytorch. The goal is to accurately classify images into 10 categories such as airplane, car, bird, cat, and more.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The **CIFAR-10 dataset** consists of 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class:
- **Image Size**: 32x32 pixels
- **Channels**: RGB (3 channels)
- **Train/Test Split**: 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images

### 🏷️ Classes

['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer',
'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']
